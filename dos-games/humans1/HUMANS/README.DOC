		HINTS & TIPS
Every level IS possible. In the higher levels the obvious path is almost
CERTAINLY the wrong path. So THINK.

Save time by pushing UP to stack.
Remember, You can DROP spears to friends as well as THROWING them.
Do NOT run over the toe of the witchdoctor with the wheel!
Be very careful when using the TORCH. Move everyone AWAY from the  
Torch when a HUMANS is igniting something. 
Otherwise its HUMANS a la Flambe.

		NOT ENOUGH MEMORY?
We have provided in this install program the ability to create a BOOT
Disk. For this you will need a BLANK disk for drive A: 
Do NOT use your humans disk as a BOOT disk. All information will
be ERASED.


Alternatively buy a commercial MEMORY manager to help you free
up room to run HUMANS.
